excerpt: How and why designers, developers and hybrids contribute to open source projects.

---

Design and Technology have been growing closer in the last couple of years, which has made ideas and products grow in new dimensions that attempt to captivate users through different means. Not only is science making it possible for us to print food, but there is also a concern regarding how these sci-fi inventions will fulfil more than just a functional purpose. Frontiers in fields are being crossed to let much more interesting creations break out and, along this path, walls between different kinds of skilled people are being torn down as well. 

As mentioned in a previous article, "Finding the bridge between inventive worlds", the purpose of our research was to understand these new dynamics between developers and designers. Based on a the interviews performed previously, a questionnaire was created for designers, developers and hybrids (designers/developers). 
With 4 main categories (Work Environment, Sharing, Tools & Open Source), we collected information regarding:

- How was the interaction among the groups at work
- Their thoughts about sharing final designs, process and code
- The type of tools they use and their efficiency
- What is their idea of Open Source

For three weeks, the thoughts of 150 great professionals in 30 countries were gathered. From Argentina to Indonesia, novice to experts helped us discover the facts of this evolution.

##Work Environment: The real picture


Designers work quite often with developers (75%), while developers are not so lucky to have the same amount of interaction with designers (39.3%). However, they would like to do so (73.2%), which is one step closer towards the ultimate goal: help them discover how to integrate their expertise and generate stunning results. Not enough interaction, not enough understanding, not enough cool projects to blow people’s minds. 

A bigger amount of hybrids (68%) works frequently with developers and slightly less (54%) with designers. From the interviews we performed in the first stage, these cases sound like the ones where there is one person in the project in charge of the design and user experience of the product. It makes sense that hybrids might work a bit more with developers than with other designers.

"Communication" had been one of the main issues that popped up constantly with our interviewees. We wondered if communication issues were mainly due to not speaking in common terms (“Commit where?” “Vectorize what?”), yet around 60% expressed that they were able to find a common language either often or all the time. Hybrids, as expected, scored higher in this matter (82%). Just like expressing things in a correct language is important, so is listening to the other side. According to the results, there is still room for improvement in that area as well.

Knowledge transfer from developers to designers was mostly done on a regular basis for 75.6% of designers. Most of them (58.5%) acknowledged that developers also want "easy to implement" designs but they mostly keep a positive attitude and don't normally refuse to implement their designs because of technical difficulties (56.1%). 

##Sharing final designs, process & code: The fear of letting go


The core of our research: what are they sharing? why are they or why aren’t they doing so? 
A finished design is something to be proud of and cherished. This matches the results of sharing them to be viewed or commented versus having them available for free, not knowing who will use them (where 70-80+% acknowledged that they don’t do it currently). However, there was a tendency towards sharing more out in the open if possible, just not if there’s a commercial purpose behind. 

For developers, on the other hand, having their code being used for commercial purposes is no big of a deal. In fact, twice the number of developers that currently share their code  agreed to liking to share more of it in this situation. Developers see an opportunity while designers might see danger in doing so. Which are the terms that draw in one group but repel the other? 

Perhaps it relies on the fact that designs have an emotional attachment: 
*“It depends: if it's something that I was working on for a longer time and I feel that the result is finalized, then it's an art piece, polished, I wouldn't be ok if someone would be playing with it”.*

Hybrids followed similar trends as designers in current sharing of the work, yet their responses - as to how much they would like to share and in which conditions - resembled more of those from developers.
Another premise that was truly of our concern was the one related to fear: maybe designers are afraid of criticism? The tendency slightly leaned towards disagreeing with this, yet designers were pretty much distributed equally across the range of options: from strongly disagree to agree; only 2.3% of designers accepted they strongly agree with the statement. How to make them feel a bit safer? 

Strong agreements were demonstrated towards activities such as looking at finished designs or code to learn, reading comments to improve their designs or code, acknowledging that sharing is a good way to showcase their own work and being recognized in the community. 

During our interviews, “copying” was also a matter of concern; one comment from the survey pointed out that “it is pretty common that people from the field steal completely the designed art.” Having designs copied is indeed an issue, yet it’s not seen as an activity that decreases their value for 65.2% of the designers group nor for 77.8% of developers and hybrids.

Sharing the process of how a designer materializes their creation is slightly different, in terms that designers do it but it’s not as trendy as sharing a finished product. Sharing process is not as desired as sharing final designs and the threat of losing value due to possible copies is less than with final designs. Should it be riskier to show the process? 

One respondent mentioned: *“I feel that there is another aspect to design that feels generally overlooked and that the questions of this survey confirms... it has to do with ‘purpose’”.* It’s not just about sharing but about their works’ destiny: are designers hesitant to expose their work because they are unsure of what their fate will be?

##Tools & learning: Barriers or doors?


There’s a flood of tools out there that make it possible to interact with others, disclose our creations and let us be prosumers. For designers, tools used for remote collaboration, sharing final designs and getting feedback appear to be well known, while those used to contribute to projects and disclosing their process are a tad foreign. Names like Dribbble, Trello, Slack and Behance are familiar; Github and Pixelapse share a different profile. Between 65 to 80% are “somewhat acquainted” to “not acquainted at all” with these kinds of tools.

For developers, “remote collaboration” tools were surprisingly unfamiliar to 20.4%.
Hybrids stand in the best position by being acquainted with all categories of tools, yet the ones used to share design process were also unfamiliar to 75% of this group. Tools to get feedback on designs got little recognition as well, making 33.3% of the hybrids not to grade them at all.

Evaluations on show a relatable trend: those with the lowest grades were the unpopular ones. Specially, tools for sharing the process are the least known (40% chose to not rate them and 53.5% were “little” to “not at all” acquainted with them). 
This states a question prior to “why is process not shared that much?”, which is “how can process be shared more if tools are not part of designers’ environment?”

For developers, 23.5% decided that “remote collaboration” tools were out of their scope to grade. As a participant in the survey stated: 
*“It is totally needed a stronger and faster communication/interaction between developers and designers, even more of these tools are needed to improve this relationship. Definitely a good path for it is the open source.” *

##Open Source: Pull, push, give and take


As more and more people get their hands on building digital pieces, the idea of “openness” is reaching further areas that go from code to fashion to medicine. 

Designers know about the Open Source concept (89.1%) but the Open Source applied to design is still the “new kid on the block” (59.8% knew about it). For them, joining the Open Source world and participating was thought to be driven mostly by: the ability to share solutions (86%), try new things (81.1%), educate others (80%) and be part of something important (77.7%).

Codewise, developers already contribute to Open Source projects and use pieces of it. Although 80% contributes seldom - while 81.8% uses it often or always - 67.2% would like to participate more often or all the time in its creation. 
For developers, Open Source contributions are appealing in order to share solution (89.23%), be part of something important (74.6%), be recognized (72.8%) and gain confidence on their skills (72.3%).

Most designers didn’t know projects that would need their help (66.3%) nor of spaces where they could find them (73.6%), but a majority was interested in joining them (87.8%) and this is a great start! Half of the developers know projects that would require design help, which is encouraging since there is definitely a demand of design magic out there. 

Designers mainly disclosed that they would like to contribute with UX/UI (86%), Web design (72.1%) and Wireframes (61.1%) among others. Developers, on the other hand, would like to get help on UX/UI (77.1%), Web Design (66.7%), Icons/Graphics (50%) and Branding (47.9%). 
It’s interesting how the concept of wireframes -for developers- was not thought to be that much needed, yet this is a fundamental piece in the planning process of projects that require a UI. 
Just like the Sunlight Foundation team mentioned: 
*“Well, no, we can't fix it because we weren't there, we weren't able to help you design the solution. We can fix some of the problems but we are not solving the main problems. We can put little design 'band-aids' in your project but..."*
...band-aids are not really something the helps to make interaction with the product flawless and delightful.

Overall, this process was enlightening, getting to know both sides made us realize that the gap between both worlds is much more narrow than what we had thought and this sounds promising. With these insights, we know that Open Design Foundation can address the obstacles and speed bumps to make it faster and more pleasant for designers to join the world of sharing.
Contribution is the future, so why not engage now?
