Finding the bridge between inventive worlds

A peanut butter sandwich is great by itself, but mixing some jelly makes the experience sublime. Just like PB & J, designers and developers deliver excellent outcomes on their own yet, when combining efforts, the results become amazing!

For the past month and a half, as part of our learning experience while working with Design Open team, we started a quest to search for a better understanding on how these two groups of people come together. DesignOpen's manifesto states clear and simple principles, but we wondered if there were  hidden things in the minds of potential contributors that could improve the way the initiative is growing up.

During this first stage, a small research team (Alicja, Jan and myself) defined topics that we considered interested to get more insights about. The main concerns were:

* What's it like to work with the opposite group?
* How important is the awareness of design?
* Is Open Source truly popular among both groups?

These topics made it possible to come up with semi-structured interviews -one for designers, one for developers-, remembering that time is precious for anyone so, we tried to keep them short but sharp.

Once the sets of questions were drafted, we faced a new problem: where were we going to find people to answer them? Because of our IT background, developers were somehow easier to find in our closer circles; designers, however, were a bit further away. With posts on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ and StackOverflow, it seemed that we were going to succeed rapidly in this task...but social media proved that to be wrong. We felt like recruiters, trying to grab people's attention but the problem was that we were looking for this specific set of people (developers who had worked in a team where design was involved and designers who had worked in a team where development was involved) and finding them, getting them to spend their time with us and making them interested in doing so was indeed a challenge.
After a couple of rough weeks, Una & Garth were kind to give us a hand and spread the word about our research, which brought more people in and allowed us to finish this first stage.
We were able to pick different brains in 3 continents, from students to directors, men and women, all of them with new thoughts and anecdotes that became new pieces to get a more detailed picture.
After all the Skype call and Hangout sessions, we organized the data and found out interesting beliefs such as:

* Speaking a different language. Not necessarily English and Urdu but terms in both environments. Vectors and SVGs are not the same as Vectors and LinkedLists.
* Sharing work can become scary because of criticism. This may halt them from contributing since they are exposed to anything and, well, nobody really wants to read messages from haters.
* Both groups think that functionality is key. Designers made remarks about the fact that it's not just making something look pretty.
* Designers don't necessarily look for fame but they like knowing their brand is recognized.
* Open Source Design sounds like a utopic idea because of the lack of available technology for it, yet the interest to check it out exists.

Overall, this has given us a better ground on which to stand in order to get more solid data out a soon-to-be-released survey. We look forward to see how this evolves and hope that the results make DesignOpenâ€™s scope richer.
