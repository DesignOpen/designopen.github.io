[Una Kravets](http://twitter.com/una), [Christopher Moody](http://twitter.com/terracomma), and [I](http://twitter.com/garthdb) have been working to put together a workshop on open design and we're happy to announce that [Future of Web Design](https://futureofwebdesign.com/san-francisco-2015/schedule/workshops/1967) will be hosting the inaugural workshop in San Francisco on Oct 28th 2015.

The workshop is designed to teach all the best parts of open source workflows and how we can apply them to design in open source and proprietary projects.

You can find the full description for the workshop below or on the [FOWD](https://futureofwebdesign.com/san-francisco-2015/schedule/workshops/1967) website.

We'd love to see you there. Also [Una](https://futureofwebdesign.com/san-francisco-2015/speakers/una-kravets) and [I](https://futureofwebdesign.com/san-francisco-2015/speakers/garth-braithwaite) will be giving presentations during the main days of the conference as well.

Full Description:

Using the term Open Source Design gets interesting reactions from different people. It isn’t about working for free, doing design by committee, or dealing with trolls. It is about challenging ourselves, as designers and developers to look at our design processes and the way we work together in the design community. Although it takes some effort, open collaboration can be a truly effective workflow for taking full advantage of designers and developers’ potential. In this full-day, interactive workshop you will get hands on experience working with open workflows and various tools including Git, GitHub, Jekyll, Preprocessors (Sass, Less, Jade, Slim, etc), Codekit, Waffle.io and Pixelapse. You will work collaboratively in teams on moodboards, style tiles, brand mockups, wireframes, UI, mockups, sitemaps and prototypes to build a front-end website for a number of open source projects. This workshop is for designers and front-end developers with basic design and/or front-end development skills. All you will need is your laptop installed with Ruby, Jekyll, and Git. If you have any troubles getting things setup, reach out and let us know ahead of time.

What you'll learn

* How designers can open source
* How to implement an open workflow with your team
* How to leverage open workflows in open collaboration
* How to integrate elements of the Open Source Design Manifesto including:
* Design in the open
* Share your design experiences (both good and bad)
* Do meaningful work
* Openly participate in design discussions
* Work with other designers by choice
* Improve your toolbox
