excerpt: Open Source Design is coming to a conference near you; maybe.

The ultimate goal of this project is to get more designers and developers collaborating together in the open, to that end I'm speaking at a few conferences to help designers and/or developers do just that.

If you are headed to these conferences come out to my session (RSVP for the MAX session). If you aren't planning to attend you should anyway.

If there is a conference or meetup you'd like us to speak at, let us know by commenting on [this issue](https://github.com/designopen/designopen.github.io/issues/29) or reach out to me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/garthdb).
