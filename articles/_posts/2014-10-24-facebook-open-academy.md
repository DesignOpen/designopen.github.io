Design Open is excited to announce that we have been invited to participate in [Facebook's Open Academy Program](https://www.facebook.com/OpenAcademyProgram) and we now have 5 university students contributing some of their time this semester to the Design Open project. 

I'm pleased to introduce [David Wei](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-yuxuan-wei/95/488/77/), [Elaine Hwang](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elaine-hwang/9b/830/739), and [Kevin Ngo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngovkevin) from <abbr title="University of California San Diego">UCSD</abbr>, as well as [Becca Hallac](http://rebeccahallac.com) and [Sacha Best](http://linkedin.com/in/sachabest) from <abbr title="University of Pennsylvania">UPENN</abbr> as our newest contributors. They have decided to tackle the [Design Open job board](https://github.com/DesignOpen/board). [Chris Moody](http://twitter.com/terracomma) and I had the pleasure of participating in an initial orientation and project sprint with them in person at Facebook's headquarters earlier this month, and they are fantastic.

We're trying to give these talented students the best open source experience we can. Please jump in to review their design, code, and/or content. [File issues](https://github.com/DesignOpen/board/issues/) and join the discussion to help mentor these remarkable students.
