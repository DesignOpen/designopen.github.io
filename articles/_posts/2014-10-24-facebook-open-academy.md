I'm pleased to introduce [David Wei](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-yuxuan-wei/95/488/77/), [Elaine Hwang](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elaine-hwang/9b/830/739), and [Kevin Ngo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngovkevin) from <abbr title="University of California San Diego">UCSD</abbr>, as well as [Becca Hallac](http://rebeccahallac.com) and [Sacha Best](http://linkedin.com/in/sachabest) from <abbr title="University of Pennsylvania">UPENN</abbr> as our newest contributors. They have decided to tackle the [Open Design job board](https://github.com/DesignOpen/board). [Chris Moody](http://twitter.com/terracomma) and I had the pleasure of participating in an initial orientation and project sprint with them in person at Facebook's headquarters earlier this month, and they are fantastic.
