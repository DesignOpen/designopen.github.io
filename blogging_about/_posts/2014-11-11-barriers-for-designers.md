excerpt: At SassConf this year, there was a lot of talk about why designers don't contribute to open source, and how we can start to influence change.

- my background

- sassconf

- open source projects
- beautiful open

- the barriers for designers: github, prior knowledge of jekyll, etc. even "join us on IRC" is really exclusive to developers, fuck you pay me mentality

- how this system can improve to be more engaging to designers
	- no word of contributing (i.e. Bundle install, etc.)
	- 

Lets look at the process for contributing to this project, which is aimed at getting designers to design more in the open: 

	1. Stumble upon this page
	2. Open the link to Github
	3. Have a Github account
	4. Know about Github Contribution workflow
	5. Fork the Repo
	6. Know that I need to install dependancies 
	7. Know HOW to install dependancies
	8. Run Jekyll server
	9. Write in markdown or with HTML tags
	10. know about the config file and how to add authors
	10. know how to commit changes to my GH repo
	11. know how to submit pull requests

A lot of assumptions are made here
