Design Open has been picked up by [Facebook Open Academy](https://www.facebook.com/OpenAcademyProgram) and we now have 5 university students contributing some of their time this quarter to the Design Open project. I'm pleased to introduce David Wei, Elaine Hwang, and, Kevin Ngo from UCSD, and, Becca Hallac, and Sacha Best from UPENN as our newest contributors. They have decided to tackle the [Design Open job board](https://github.com/DesignOpen/board). [Chris Moody](http://twitter.com/terracomma) and I had the pleasure to do an initial sprint with them in person at the Facebook HQ earlier this month, and they are fantastic.

We're trying to give these talented students the best open source experience we can. Please jump in to review their design, code, and/or content. [File issues](https://github.com/DesignOpen/board/issues/) and help mentor these students.
