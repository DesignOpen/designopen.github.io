In the Spring of last year, [Bermon Painter](http://www.twitter.com/bermonpainter) sent me an invitation to speak at [Blend Conf](http://www.blendconf.com), his new conference in Charlotte, NC.  When I asked him what I should speak on, his response was "You can talk about whatever you want." It felt like a signed blank check.

After some deep soul searching, and talks with friends, I put together the session Designers Can Open Source, I wrote the [Open Source Design Manifesto](/blogging_about/the-open-source-design-manifesto/), and purchased the designopen.org domain.

[Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/blend-conference-2013) recorded the session and just released the video file to me to post.

I really appreciate the opportunity Blend Conf provided me (I've already bought my [ticket for 2014](https://tito.io/blendconf/blendconf2014)), and all the community help with this project.
