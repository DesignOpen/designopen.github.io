A Jekyll based site providing resources and discussion for designers wanting to work in the open.

##Right now

It is a work in progress for sure.  Right now we are working the kicking off the visual design.  Feel free to jump into the [discussion](https://github.com/opensourcedesignis/opensourcedesignis.github.io/issues/14).

## Contribute to the Discussion

Join us in the [Open Source Design Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/DesignOpen/OpenSourceDesign) and make some comments in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/DesignOpen/designopen.github.io/issues).

## Contributing Posts

Feel free to contribute your own posts and ideas on this topic! Here's how:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo
2. Clone your new fork onto your system and navigate into it
3. Install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) if you don't have it installed yet.
4. Run the command: `bundle install` to install ruby dependancies
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` to start the server and watch for changes
6. Navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:4000/` in your browser to see your site running locally
7. Write new posts in the *articles/_posts* folder
8. Add your author information in the *_config.yml* file
9. When you're ready, send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to the original repo!

*If this is your first time using Jekyll, read [this](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) first. An important item of note is: do NOT touch the _site folder! This is where Jekyll is working to recompile changes into. Any time you make a change, it will overwrite whatever is inside of that folder.*

[This](/articles/how-to-contribute/) post also helps to explain how to contribute to a Jekyll site via Github.

##Etc.

I'm taking screenshots of the design as it progresses - sizing the window to 1024x900 px.
