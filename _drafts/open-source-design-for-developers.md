In addition to pushing designers toward open collaboration, I've also begun speaking at open source development conferences with 2 goals in mind:

1. Help developers learn how to foster a budding design community within the open source community.
2. Encourage developers to learn the design skills they could use to help in improving the standard of design quality in open source projects.

I do not believe that developers are incapable of learning design principles or that they are only able to produce developer art. I do belive that the development community has a vast pool of experience that could benefit the design community. Not every developer will become senior designers, but with encouragement, motivation, and direction, anyone can improve their design skills.
