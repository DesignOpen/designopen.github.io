Recently I've learned that I haven't been giving GitHub enough credit. The power of collaboration, even for a design project like this is truly magical. 

I've worked on a couple of design teams. Many of them weren't really collaborative. It's not their fault. The fact is, that Photoshop and Fireworks[^1] files don't lend themselves for collaboration. And to be honest, most of us Designers hate it when you touch our files.[^2]

However, with Open Source Design, we're tossing these old ways to the side and trying something new, and that's where GitHub issues come into play.
