I haven't been giving GitHub enough credit. The power of collaboration, even for a design project like this is truly magical. 

I've worked on a couple of design teams. Many of them weren't really collaborative. It's not their fault. The fact is, that Photoshop and Fireworks[^1] files don't lend themselves for collaboration. And to be honest, most of us Designers hate it when you touch our files.[^2]

However, with Open Source Design, we're tossing these old ways to the side and trying something new, and that's where GitHub issues come into play.

## Ideas Snowball
I've only been working on this project for about a week and a half, and you should see how many issues we already have open, and how many people are giving their two cents. It's amazing. What's even better is that ideas begin rough, and together with the other smart people working on the project, the ideas evolve and turn into diamonds.

And that's what this is all about. It doesn't matter who you are, how much experience you have, nothing. You can contribute and collaborate on this project, because we're all learning together. 
With so many minds working together, the possibilities are endless.

If you want to get involved, please do! Even if you don't feel comfortable pushing code, we'd love to see more people in the issue comments.
