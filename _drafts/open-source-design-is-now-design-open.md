Thanks to some timely posts to our [GitHub issue on branding](https://github.com/DesignOpen/designopen.github.io/issues/33#issuecomment-56763448) we decided to rethink the name of this project. Originally I planned for the site to be a definitive guide on what open source design is, hence the original domain name, opensourcedesign.is, but that has become too limiting for the direction this project is heading. Instead we are moving to a call for action: *Design Open!*

The removal of the term open source from the title does not signify we are going to stop encouraging designers to open source their work, or to collaborate on open source projects. On the contrary, we want to encourage all designers to put forth real effort to design in the open. Show your work, process, and mistakes. It's good for the community, but more importantly, it is good for your own personal growth as a designer to honestly track progress.

From designing in the open it is a short leap to open source design. Put a good open license on work you think could benefit others and post it publicly.

##Open Source Design for Developers

In addition to pushing designers toward open collaboration, I've also begun speaking at open source development conferences with 2 goals in mind:

1. Help developers learn how to foster a budding design community within the open source community.
2. Encourage developers to learn the design skills they could use to help in improving the standard of design quality in open source projects.

I do not believe that developers are incapable of learning design principles or that they are only able to produce developer art. I do belive that the development community has a vast pool of experience that could benefit the design community. Not every developer will become senior designers, but with encouragement, motivation, and direction, anyone can improve their design skills.

##The Call

A while ago this site hit the front page of Designer News and the traffic spiked dramatically. It was wonderful to get the exposure, but ultimately I found it a little disappointing that it didn't lead to any significant, trackable increase in discussion. This is not merely a nice idea, it is a call to shed our insecurities, pride, and paralyzing perfectionism; to dedicate effort to helping worthy causes; and to raise the quality of design and design education on the web. A call to design open.
