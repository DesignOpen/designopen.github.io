# Installing dependencies
The [opensourcedesign.is](http://opensourcedesign.is) website is on GitHub pages, which runs atop of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). To run Jekyll locally, we'll need to install Ruby as well.

### Installation for OS X:

1. Fire Up Terminal
3. Install Jekyll by running `sudo gem install jekyll`. The build process typically takes a few minutes. It'll look like absolutely nothing is happening, but stuff is definitely happening.
4. After installation, type `jekyll --version` and hit enter. It should spit out the current version of Jekyll, which at the time of writing this is `jekyll 1.0.1`. At this point, you're ready to clone the repo!
