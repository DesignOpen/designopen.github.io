After struggling a bit with finding interviewees for the first stage of our research, I am very glad to know about a project that implements the "open" concept in another way. 

For now, "Open Humans" is mostly aimed towards health projects and it's a bit limited since it just kicked off; however, it has a great potential for anyone with a project that involves people.
I'm actually excited about the fact that those (sometimes) long boring surveys have a chance to be revamped by awesome designers willing to contribute :)
